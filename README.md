I have some programs designed to calculate travel times under a constant acceleration. I am still working on it, and there are some assumptions I am making. I am assuming that all of the planets lie on the ecliptic, and orbit circularly. At some point I am going to make a more detailed model, and probably a relativistic one for going between stars. I also do not have a minimum distance from the sun.
